/// @notice please read carefully unchecked comments, there are some requirements tht must be met in order to not
/// over/under flow
/// @dev Rounding error policy.
/// We're always rounding down by using build-in solidity way for division.
///
/// During normalization we're executing division by `_normalizationDivider` (unless there is multiplicator)
/// and `_secondPrice` (in case second price exist). You can expect rounding errors to be in exclusive range of (0, 1)
/// when doing division. What does it means? This means, that you can be short by up to 1 wei on result.
/// eg. when normalising 12_345 (value with 3 decimals) to 2 decimals representation you lose last digit and end result
/// will be 12_34.
/// What are consequences for protocol?
/// Eg. if 987 of tokens A is worth 12.34 tokens B (after normalization), by losing 0.005 we made tokens A worth a bit
/// more than they really are. If we would round up, then tokens A would be a bit less expensive.
/// Keep in mind we are talking tiny values. There is no argument that can tell which approach is correct.
/// Considering that prices themselves are changing constantly (if you think about it, they are just random numbers
/// close to previous value) and even TWAP price can be manipulated up to some level, if we compare this to rounding
/// error, the rounding error has no meaning at all.
/// Most important part is: how are we using prices in Silo and how rounding error affects the system?
/// We're using prices to calculate LTV. We're deciding how much of token you can borrow but once you borrow you need to
/// repay that amount (plus interest). Price of the token has no influence on how much you repay.
/// Price change by 1 wei can also trigger liquidation, but it will be like switching from eg. 9,99999999999% => 10%.
/// Summing up, rounding error can affect:
/// - max amount of tokens one can borrow
/// - when liquidation happen
/// nn both cases we are talking about 1 wei of difference and this really does not matter to the protocol.
/// It cannot make user to repay less than he borrow and it cannot affect any other operations like deposit,
/// withdraw in a way, that you get less/more tokens.
/// That said, choosing rounding policy is arbitrary decision and our decision is to use default rounding down.
