This repository contains the Balancer Protocol V2 core smart contracts, including the `Vault` and standard Pools, along with their tests, configuration, and deployment information.

For a high-level introduction to Balancer V2, see [Introducing Balancer V2: Generalized AMMs](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/balancer-v2-generalizing-amms-16343c4563ff).

## Structure

This is a Yarn 2 monorepo, with the packages meant to be published in the [`pkg`](./pkg) directory. Newly developed packages may not be published yet.

Active development occurs in this repository, which means some contracts in it might not be production-ready. Proceed with caution.

### Packages

- [`v2-interfaces`](./pkg/interfaces): Solidity interfaces for all contracts.
- [`v2-vault`](./pkg/vault): the [`Vault`](./pkg/vault/contracts/Vault.sol) contract and all core interfaces, including [`IVault`](./pkg/interfaces/contracts/vault/IVault.sol) and the Pool interfaces: [`IBasePool`](./pkg/interfaces/contracts/vault/IBasePool.sol), [`IGeneralPool`](./pkg/interfaces/contracts/vault/IGeneralPool.sol) and [`IMinimalSwapInfoPool`](./pkg/interfaces/contracts/vault/IMinimalSwapInfoPool.sol).
- [`v2-pool-utils`](./pkg/pool-utils): Solidity utilities used to develop Pool contracts.
- [`v2-solidity-utils`](./pkg/solidity-utils): miscellaneous Solidity helpers and utilities used in many different contracts.
- [`v2-standalone-utils`](./pkg/standalone-utils): miscellaneous standalone utility contracts.
- [`v2-liquidity-mining`](./pkg/liquidity-mining): contracts that compose the liquidity mining (veBAL) system.

## Pre-requisites

The build & test instructions below should work out of the box with Node ^14.18.0. (Please note that it needs Node 14 specifically, and will NOT work with Node 16 or higher. Minor version should be at least 18).

Multiple Node versions can be installed in the same system, either manually or with a version manager.
One option to quickly select the suggested Node version is using `nvm`, and running:

```bash
$ nvm use
```

## Clone

This repository uses git submodules; use `--recurse-submodules` option when cloning. For example, using https:

```bash
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo.git
```

## Build and Test

Before any tests can be run, the repository needs to be prepared:

```bash
$ yarn # install all dependencies
$ yarn build # compile all contracts
```

Most tests are standalone and simply require installation of dependencies and compilation. Some packages however have extra requirements. Notably, the [`v2-deployments`](./pkg/deployments) package must have access to mainnet archive nodes in order to perform fork tests. For more details, head to [its readme file](./pkg/deployments/README.md).

In order to run all tests (including those with extra dependencies), run:

```bash
$ yarn test # run all tests
```

To instead run a single package's tests, run:

```bash
$ cd pkg/<package> # e.g. cd pkg/v2-vault
$ yarn test
```

You can see a sample report of a test run [here](./audits/test-report.md).

### Foundry (Forge) tests

To run Forge tests, first [install Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation). The installation steps below apply to Linux or MacOS. Follow the link for additional options.

```bash
$ curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
$ source ~/.bashrc # or open a new terminal
$ foundryup
```

Then, to run tests in a single package, run:
```bash
$ cd pkg/<package> # e.g. cd pkg/v2-vault
$ yarn test-fuzz
```

## Security

Multiple independent reviews and audits were performed by [Certora](https://www.certora.com/), [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/) and [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/). The latest reports from these engagements are located in the [`audits`](./audits) directory.

Bug bounties apply to most of the smart contracts hosted in this repository: head to [Balancer V2 Bug Bounties](https://docs.balancer.fi/reference/contracts/security.html#bug-bounty) to learn more. Alternatively, send an email to security@balancer.finance.

All core smart contracts are immutable, and cannot be upgraded. See page 6 of the [Trail of Bits audit](https://github.com/balancer-labs/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/audits/trail-of-bits/2021-04-02.pdf):

> Upgradeability | Not Applicable. The system cannot be upgraded.
